Implementation Roadmap & Top Priorities

Based on complexity and impact, we recommend a phased approach:

Week 1:  QR Code Generator

Week 2:  Image Compressor (JS libraries like jpeg-js).

Week 4-6: Image Background Remover , and Financial Calculators (mortgage, percentage, requiring formula logic).

Each tool launch should include SEO support: dedicate a descriptive page or section optimized for relevant keywords (e.g. “free qr code generator”, “online color palette maker”). Include explanatory content, examples, and FAQs to improve search rankings. We should track metrics like organic search volume (via Google Search Console), click-through rates on search snippets, and on-page conversions (tool usage counts).

Top 3–4 Picks: Based on ease and demand, we prioritize (1) Unit Converter, (2) QR Code Generator, (3) Password Generator, and (4) Word/Character Counter. These cover very high-volume needs and can be built quickly in-browser, establishing early organic traffic channels. Subsequent high priorities would be Currency Converter and Lorem Ipsum Generator, each also drawing steady search interest. Finally, iteratively add the more complex tools (image/PDF utilities, calculators) while monitoring user engagement and SEO performance to guide further enhancements.
